        </div>
        <div class='modal-body'>
          <p>THE LAW FIRM OF JESSE HERMAN LAW recognizes the importance of privacy and the sensitivity of personal information.  Our relationship with you is founded on trust and we are committed to maintaining that trust. As lawyers we have a professional obligation to keep confidential all information we receive within a lawyer-client relationship.</p>
           
          <p>For these reasons, we have created the following privacy policy ( the "Policy").  This Privacy Policy outlines how we manage your personal information and safeguard your privacy.</p>
           
          <h4>Your Privacy Rights</h4>
           
          <p>All businesses engaged in commercial activities must comply with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and the Canadian Standards Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information, which it incorporates.</p>

          <p>These obligations extend to lawyers and law firms, including ours.  The Act gives you rights concerning the privacy of your personal information.</p>
           
          <p>Jesse Herman Law is responsible for the personal information we collect and hold.  To ensure this accountability, we have developed this policy, and trained our lawyers and support staff about our policies and practices.</p>
           
          <h4>A.  AN OVERVIEW</h4>

          <h4>1. WHAT THIS POLICY  COVERS </h4>

          <p>This Policy covers our treatment of the personal information we collect from you.</p>
           
          <h4>2. PURPOSES  FOR COLLECTION  OF PERSONAL  INFORMATION </h4>

          <p>Our firm collects personal information for the following limited purposes:</p>

            <li>to represent you as our client;</li>
            <li>to administer our client (time and billing databases); and</li>
            <li>to establish and maintain mailing lists.</li>
            <li>HOW DO WE COLLECT YOUR  PERSONAL  INFORMATION?</li> 
          </ol>

          </ol>

            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>2. IDENTIFYING  PURPOSES</h4>

          <p>Our firm is committed to openness to you regarding its collection and use of personal information.  As discussed above, we collect and use personal information for the following limited purposes:</p>

            <li>to represent clients;</li>
            <li>to administer our client (time and billing databases); and</li>
            <li>to establish and maintain mailing lists.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>To demonstrate this openness, we require the consent of our clients and mailing list subscribers prior to using their personal information for any purpose other than that for which it is originally collected.</p>
           
          <p>If any individuals wish to be advised of the personal information we have in relation to them,  they are advised to follow the procedure listed in Section C below.</p>

          <h4>3. CONSENT </h4>

          <p>All of our employees, personnel or agents are instructed to provide information about how personal information is used by us to all interested individuals who inquire, as well as how to obtain the consents necessary from those who provide their personal information.</p>

          <h4>4. LIMITING COLLECTION</h4>

          <p>For this resaon, our firm does not indiscriminately collect personal information.  We collect personal information to fulfill the above-noted purposes only, and for no other purpose.</p>
           
          <h4>5. LIMITING USE, DISCLOSURE AND RETENTION</h4>

          <p>Our firm does not use personal information for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected, unless it has first obtained the consent of the person from whom such information was received.</p>
           
          <p>Further, Jesse Herman Law will only disclose your personal information under the following circumstances:</p>
          <ul>

            <li>where it is necessary to establish or collect fees;</li>
            <li>if we engage a third party to provide administrative services to us (such as back-up services or archival file storage) and the third party is bound by our privacy policy;</li>
            <li>if we engage expert witnesses on your behalf;</li>
            <li>if we retain other law firms in other jurisdictions,  on your behalf;</li>
            <li>if the information is already publicly known.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We retain personal information only for as long as it is needed and only for the fulfillment of the purposes for which it was originally collected.</p>

          <h4>6. ACCURACY</h4>
           
          <p>Since we use your personal information to provide legal services to you, it is important that the information be accurate and up-to-date.</p>

            <li>information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings against you; </li>
            <li>when granting you access would have an unreasonable impact on other people's privacy; </li>
